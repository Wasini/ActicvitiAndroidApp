# ActicvitiAndroidApp

Final project for the subject "Gestión y Tecnologías de Procesos de Negocios (3371)" - Universidad Nacional de Río Cuarto.

An application was requested that will connect to a remote server in which an activiti instance runs (https://www.activiti.org), obtain data of certain tasks, and provide a simple way to complete them.

More specifically, this application will be used by the manager of a company, who must approve or deny the opening of accounts for certain clients.
